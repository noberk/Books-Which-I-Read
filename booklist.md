不能 “只学英语”，这就好像用计算机绘图，只学 “Photoshop” 是不够的，要有足够的色彩、手绘基本训练，才能够自由创作一样。有几本书，建议所有想获得正确思考能力，进而表达清晰的人阅读。

Thought and Knowledge: An Introduction to Critical Thinking 4th edition, by Diane F. Halpern
Thinking and Deciding, 4th edition, by Jonathan Baron
Argumentation: The Study of Effective Reasoning by Zarefsky David (Audiobook)
Craft of Research, by Wayne C. Booth, Gregory G. Colomb, Joseph M. Williams
Good Reasoning Matters!: A Constructive Approach to Critical Thinking 3rd edition, by Leo A. Groarke, Christopher W. Tindale
另外，还有三本关于文风（Style）的书籍也一定要看：

A Plain English Handbook (1998), from Security and Exchange Commission, Prefaced by Warren E. Buffett (http://www.plainlanguage.gov)
On Writing: A Memoir of The Craft by Stephen King (with audiobook) Style: Toward Clarity and Grace by Joseph M. Williams
另外，还有一个 TTC (The Teaching Company)的视频教程，是我所见过最好的写作课程：

Building Great Sentences。
