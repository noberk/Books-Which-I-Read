# Staking

Staking means holding a digital currency in a wallet for a fixed time and receiving rewards for the stake.

- Coin holders can validate transactions on the network.
- Staking offers rewards that are an additional source of income.
- Staking is an energy-efficient process i.e it doesn’t require huge amounts of electricity.
- No specific hardware requirements, like ASIC.
- Reduces the 51% attack commonly experienced by miners

  Staking allows the coin holders to lock up their coins so that they can be randomly selected by the underlying protocol to become a validator to create a block at specific intervals. Participants having large stake values have a higher chance to be chosen as the next block validator. These block validators are responsible for checking the validity of transactions.
