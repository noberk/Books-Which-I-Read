# Maker & Taker

The makers create buying or selling orders that aren't carried out immediately (e.g., “sell BTC when the price hits $15k”). This creates liquidity, meaning it's easier for others to instantly buy or sell BTC when the condition is met. The people that buy or sell instantly are called takers.

# Staking

Staking means holding a digital currency in a wallet for a fixed time and receiving rewards for the stake.

- Coin holders can validate transactions on the network.
- Staking offers rewards that are an additional source of income.
- Staking is an energy-efficient process i.e it doesn’t require huge amounts of electricity.
- No specific hardware requirements, like ASIC.
- Reduces the 51% attack commonly experienced by miners

  Staking allows the coin holders to lock up their coins so that they can be randomly selected by the underlying protocol to become a validator to create a block at specific intervals. Participants having large stake values have a higher chance to be chosen as the next block validator. These block validators are responsible for checking the validity of transactions.

# Yield farming | Liquidity Mining

When someone lends their cryptocurrencies / "tokens" to a borrow/lend protocol, they are said to be "providing liquidity". In return, this person earns commission on the trades they facilitate. The commission is paid out in the same tokens they are providing.
