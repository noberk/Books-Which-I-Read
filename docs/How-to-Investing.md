- Years ago,I asked my rich dad, "What advice would you give to the average investor?" His reply was,"Don’t be average."
- You should combine those skills, they are Education & Experience & Excess Cash.

- Are you mentally prepared to be an investor?
- What type of investor do you want to become?
- How do you build a strong business?
- Who is a sophisticated investor?
- Giving it back

- You cannot teach someone to be a sophisticated investor. But a person can learn to become a sophisticated.📚
