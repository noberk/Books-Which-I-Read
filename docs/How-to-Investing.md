- Years ago,I asked my rich dad, "What advice would you give to the average investor?" His reply was,"Don’t be average."
- You should combine those skills, they are Education & Experience & Excess Cash.

- Are you mentally prepared to be an investor?
- What type of investor do you want to become?
- How do you build a strong business?
- Who is a sophisticated investor?
- Giving it back

- You cannot teach someone to be a sophisticated investor. But a person can learn to become a sophisticated.📚

- The rich don't work for money
- Whatever your reality is about money inside of you is the reality of money outside of you. You cannot change your outside reality until you first change your inde reality about money. - Rich Dad
- the more financial skills you have, the more abundance you will have in your life.
- the more a person seeks security, the less they can see of the opportunities that abound
- You need a plan.
